* Emacs minimal init file

The aim of this repo is to provide a minimal emacs configuration that
restricts the use external packages and tries to leverage emacs
built-in functionality.
 


** Example code

Let's see how github org mode rendering deals with literate programming blocks:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq-default
    indent-tabs-mode nil
    tab-width 4)
#+end_src

** External packages
- ef-themes
- magit
- restclient or verb
- orderless
- vertico
- consult
