* Emacs minimal init file

The aim of this repo is to provide a minimal emacs configuration that doesn't use external packages.

Tested with emacs 31.0.50 built from sources on 2024-08-07

** Example code

Let's see how github org mode rendering deals with literate programming blocks:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq-default
    indent-tabs-mode nil
    tab-width 4)
#+end_src
